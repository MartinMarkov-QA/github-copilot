<!-- This file contains automatic instructions for writing React components in the project. It is intended to ensure consistency and maintainability across the codebase and is applicable to all React components in under the `src/components` directory. 

If the apply to attribute is not specified in the file we need to use the Add Context menu to specify the files that the instructions apply to.

Always use functional components and React hooks instead of class components. This promotes better readability and maintainability of the code. Additionally, make sure to use TypeScript for type safety and to catch potential errors early in the development process.

When creating a new component, make sure to follow the existing structure and naming conventions. Each component should be placed in its own folder within the `components` directory, and the folder name should match the component name. For example, if you are creating a `Button` component, it should be located at `src/components/Button/Button.tsx`.
